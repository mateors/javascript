# Drag N Drop
Drag and drop features will be used in our new form builder project for ashley.

Whenever the user mouse moves towards the Y axis, client.Y value decreases and when the user mouse moves away Y axis, client.Y value increases this is the key idea behind mouse movement direction. Based on this decision system decide which function needs to be applied.


## Conventions to make our code cleaner and easier for quick understanding.
* Everything will be goes under `div` where possible.
* For nested `div` we will follow a naming convention
* Inside HTML Body element there always will be a main container `div` which contains all the div inside (nesting)
