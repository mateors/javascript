# Learning Javascript from scratch!
JavaScript is famously known as the language of web browsers. While it originally was only used for website development, the language has continued to evolve and grow over time.

Today, JavaScript is a powerful and fast programming language used by professionals for almost any kind of programming you can imagine. That's exactly why we start our students off on the right foot with JavaScript.

## What is "Code"?
> Code is just a series of instructions that computers can follow. Computers obey each instruction, one after another.

Programs can be comprised of many instructions. Like many. Like millions.

One of the common instructions in coding is the addition instruction.

### Logging numbers
console.log() can print text using quotes:
```console.log('some text here')```

but it can also print numbers without quotes:
```js 
console.log(1)
```
and you can do math directly inside the parentheses:
```js
console.log(4 + 3)
// prints 3
```

### Multiple Instructions
Code runs in order, starting at the top of the program. For example:
```js
console.log('this prints first')
console.log('this prints second')
console.log('this prints last')
```
Each console.log() instruction prints on a new line.
